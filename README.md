# Ticket Tracker

Ticket Tracker: https://chriskokc.github.io/ticket-tracker/
This project is built in React. The aim is for employees in a tech company to keep track of all completed tickets.

## Methodology
The concept of using components was applied in this Ticket Tracker, with props defined in a few of them, like a Button, to allow for customisation and functionality.
